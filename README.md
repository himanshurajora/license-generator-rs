# License Generator

Generate a license xml that has metadata and the signature. The signature is a SHA256 has generated bye Openssl and RSA private key. The signature exactly corresponds to license metadata so if something is changed in the license then it will become invalid hence protecting it from intended attacks.

This proram is not much significant on its own, so taking it as an example and using it's blocks for your purpose is best recommended.
